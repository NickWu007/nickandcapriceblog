Hey, welcome to the blog!

Surely you have seen a million food blogs, but I think we have something a bit different going on here. Let me explain :)

### Who we are

Before I go too deep into what the blog is about, let me quickly introduce ourselves! My name is Nick and with my partner Caprice, we wanted to save a little space for some of the food that we enjoyed together. Some of them are homemade, others we stumbled on to randomly. 

### Not just food, but stories

We all grow up eating lot of different things, and a lot of them are associated with certain episodes and memories. What I want to write here is not just recipes to make something, but also tell you what I think of when I am making it, eating it, or even serving it to others. Having no formal training to cook, we really just treat it as a hobby and something to enjoy in life. That being said, I want to help others keen to cook and spread the recipes of many delicious dishes that we have been lucky to enjoy. 

### What to look forward to here?

Partly as a new year resolution, I have decided to have a new post every week. 

Here's to an exciting year, and all the best memories!

Nick
