Continuing with the winter theme from last week, today I want to write about a particular baked sweets that both Caprice and I adore, and really is a perfect dessert to a nice dinner, or even sometimes just as a treat on its own: chocolate lava cake.

### All the magic about chocolate

As someone who generally don't have a sweet tooth, chocolate is probably the only type of sweets that I actually like. Growing up, the Dove bar at the supermarkets has always been something I begged for my parents to buy for them. There is something about the smooth texture, compounded with a bittersweet taste that makes chocolate almost magical, especially for a child.

After I moved to the UK, I discovered a new side of chocolate: its popularity as gifts. Even let alone Valentines Day, chocolate is almost always a bingo when picking a gift. It is as I said, like chocolate itself has some magical properties that everyone can't help but enjoy it. In my opinion, it is because of how versatile it is. Of course, chocolate can be made sweet with tons of sugar, but one can also enjoy the super high percentage dark chocolate. Chocolate melts with heat, and returns back to solid when cooled, so you can make all sorts of shapes and forms with it. The [easter egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg) is an excellent point. Chocolate can also be part of a dish, such as a [Mole sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(sauce)) from Mexico, or even as an accent to certain [Japanese curries](https://japantoday.com/category/features/food/you-put-what-in-your-curry-japanese-netizens-reveal-their-favorite-secret-ingredients).

As humans we also have the predisposition to be drawn to lights, such as the sun and fire, and in this context, shiny objects in general. Chocolate can be processed in a special way, which particularly accentuates this property. Through ["tempering"](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/how-to-cook/how-to-temper-chocolate), in which one gently heats up the chocolate, cools it down, and then reheat back up to slightly lower than the first time.

Of course, there are easier ways to achieve the same thing, which is just to keep the chocolate itself in a molten state. The latter we shall use today. And enough preamble, let's get started!

### The Recipe

As a first disclaimer, the recipe that I have used comes from an amalgamation of other recipes, mostly from [SortedFood](https://sortedfood.com/), a great food media worth subscribing and referencing from time to time.

First things first, the ingredients (for 4 portions):

 - 1 tbsp unsalted butter
 - 2 tbsp cocoa powder
 - 120 g unsalted butter
 - 120 g dark chocolate
 - 2 eggs
 - 2 egg yolks
 - 120 g caster sugar
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 - 30 g plain flour

#### Preparations

To begin, we will first preheat the oven to 200C/390F. While we wait, run a light layer of butter over the ramekins or any other oven-safe cups. Then, tip half a table spoon of cocoa powder into the ramekins and roll them around to coat the whole inside with the cocoa powder. The point of this is to form a layer of "coating", so to speak, with which the finished cakes can be eased out of the ramekins without breaking.

#### Making the batter

Since we are making a cake after all, we shall need a batter, in other words something with flour and turns solid after baking. Now, we dice the butter and chop the chocolate into small cubes. Microwave on high (800W) for 20 seconds at a time, stirring in between until no solids can be seen. We set the chocolate aside for it to cool a bit, while in a different mixing, bowl, crack the eggs and egg yolks, with the sugar and the salt. Whisk the mixture a bit to fully incorporated and the it should look pale and kind of frothy. Lastly, fold the chocolate mix into the eggs, taking care not to scramble the eggs, and add the flour at last and mix everything together.

#### Into the oven!

Now we are ready to bake, and the oven should have reached up to temperature. When pouring the batter into the ramekins, only fill about three quarters, since it will expand with heat, and you probably don't want overflowing cake, which would a pain to clean in the oven.

Now it is a waiting game, but chocolate lava cakes are notoriously hard to bake well, since there is only a very limited window to get it just right. The general time to aim for is 12-14 minutes, although it can vary a bit more depending on a variety of factors. A little trick that I use to gauge it is to prod the cake, not with your finger since it will burn, but with something that can convey how done it is. My favorite is a wooden spoon. It is like feeling how much a steak is done, which is somewhat ineffable and mostly comes with experience.

#### The finishing touch

Once out of the oven and cooled slightly, we can just tip the cake out upside down onto a plate, but what to pair it with? Many great options are available, but my personal preference is just with a light dusting of cocoa powder, and for Caprice, a spoonful of ice cream on top of the cake, similar to a stick toffee pudding. Other options include quite the literally cherry-on-top, ice cream but to the side, or the occasional candied fruits like pear and apple.

### The reveal

Probably the most exciting part of the lava cake, as with any surprise, is the reveal of the molten chocolaty inside. it is customary not to scoop the cake right away, but rather just parting it vertically with a spoon, so that the diner can observe the ooze of the "lava". [Here](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B6L9qfujien/?hl=en) is our first attempt, which was slightly under-baked and burnt on top no doubt, but the desired effect is still achieved.

The first winter that we spent together was one of many "new"s. For me, a new side of life with a companion was daunting at first, and I felt the need to make certain efforts, one of which is make a dessert for Caprice. Rather serendipitously, we came across a video from the SortedFood Youtube channel of just such a cake that is personal, luxurious, and perhaps just simple enough for my limited baking skills.

Having the goal set in mind, I went about getting supplies and then a night, announced my plans one night in late December. The process was not quite as hard as I expected, but much to my surprise and delight, Caprice joined me in the crammed kitchen we had and helped out. What was a gift became something like a shared adventure, so to speak, as the two of us stumbled our way to the finishing products. The results, much similar what happened in the YouTube video, was less than satisfactory. However, the night we spent, the memory, was much more cherished than the food. For me, the feeling of companionship was forever tied to the cake itself, bitter in places, but always rich and warm and eventually sweet.
