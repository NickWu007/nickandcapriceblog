Sorry I have been away for a while... Work has been really busy of late, and I find myself mostly wanting to rest for the past few weekends. With one of the big events wrapped up this week, I am finally able to come back to the blog, with one of my favorite comfort food: braised pork rice. (Incidentally, this is what I had last night)

### The name

A famous dish in Taiwan, but popular around southeast Asia in general, but the literal translation in English is not exactly accurate in my opinion. In my native Mandarin: "卤肉饭", which is by no means a sophisticated name, however just conveys the warm and comfortable feeling that it brings long.

The word "卤" (pronounced as "Lu"), which is roughly translated as "braised", has a long and rich history in Chinese culture, quite literally. In my opinion, it is a cross between pickling and marinating. The similarity to pickling is in the process: both intend to have source food (meat, vegetables, etc) brought up to boil in a special mix of liquid and then naturally cooled down and left for a long time. Instead of vinegar, "Lu" uses primarily soy sauce and Chinese five-spice. The long immersion process is then close to marinating, but you can "Lu" something for much much longer. A great example is "Lu Dan", or braised eggs. From my childhood memories, every noodle stand will have a pot of braise going on for days on end, sometimes literally forever, that is just the braising liquid and some eggs in it. When you get a bowl of noodles, a popular extra topping is one of these eggs, fished out of the pot and dunked right into the bowl.

The braised pork rice, known as a staple night stand food in Taiwan, consists of chopped braised pork belly as the center, and with a braised egg and bak chois as sides, are placed on plain rice. It has everything one needs in a meal: protein, carbohydrates, fibers, etc. The main favor is "umami", known as the fifth taste in Chinese, which is a mixture of salty and sweet. The exact taste, much like the marinara sauce from an Italian restaurant, varies from place to place. Personally, I prefer a less sweet braise, from my innate dislike of sweetness. 

Now, without further ado, let's jump into the recipe!

### Recipe

Making Lu-rou-fan at home is a bit more involved than a quick egg fried rice for sure, but the recipe that I have here is relatively easy to follow, even though it is not exactly authentic.

First things first, the ingredients. Note that what I have listed here is for a single-person portion, but you can scale it up if you are making for more.

- olive oil (a little bit is enough)
- 1 strip of pork belly (replace with any kind of mushroom + dry tofu for vegetarian)
- 1 chicken egg (remove for vegetarian)
- 1 white onion
- 2 bok choys
- spring onions 
- ginger
- garlic
- salt
- sugar (preferably brown sugar)
- soy sauces (preferably both light and dark, but not required)
- sesame oil (optional, but recommended)
- rice to your liking 

You will need a saucepan and a frying pan, and other common cookware. 

#### Step-by-step walkthrough

To begin, put the pork belly into the freezer. This make it easier to cut it into cubes later. While we wait, finely chop the onion.

Heat up the frying pan with some oil, and put the onion in after the pan has heated up. We want to caramelize the onion for the color, and to draw out the natural sweetness of the onion.

While the onion is cooking down, take the pork out of the freezer, and cut it into cubes. Cutting into smaller pieces makes it easier for the braise favor to get into the meat. If you are going for the vegetarian option, do the same with the mushrooms or tofu.

When we are finished, the onion should be nice and sweated down. Put the pork in with the onion, along with a finely chopped garlic. Cook together for a bit so that there is no raw meat to be seen, then we are ready for the braise.

Transfer everything from the frying pan into the deeper saucepan, then add 1 tablespoon each of light and dark soy sauce and sugar, half a tablespoon of sesame oil, a small block of ground ginger, and salt to taste.

Add enough water to just submerge everything, bring it up to a boil, and then turn the heat down to mid-low. Put the lid on and just let it simmer. Make sure to stir everything up a bit every few minutes, to make sure that the meat does not get stuck at the bottom of the pan.

The braise should go on for at least 30 minutes, you can add water if it gets dry too early. While we wait, it is just as well to hard boil an egg and add it into the braise too, and some bak chois for the final assembly.

Once the braise has simmered down to a desired consistency, pour it all out to some rice, add the bak choi and egg, and garnish with finely cut spring onion or sesame seeds, and we are ready to eat!

### Comfort food

I have been itching to write a whole series of comfort food, and this comes out as my top pick with little competition. My fondest memory of Lu-rou-fan was actually the last year of middle school, when we were all prepping for the final exam to get into high school. For a 15-year-old it was certainly a lot of pressure, both from school and family, so needless to say that it was probably not the happiest time in school. I remember the afterschool study groups, just after 7pm from Monday to Friday. Fortunately, there are a few hours between school and the study groups, and almost everyday I hanged out with 2-3 close friends in a diner, escaping from the pressure of the exams and just talking about stuff. We talked about the fun bits in school, plans for the summer after the exam, what we would do in the future. And surprise surprise, we did it mostly while chumping hot bowls of Lu-rou-fan. To me, it was a time to not have to worry about anything, and just be with friends. Now after a decade, the dish has become a symbol for those times, and helps with my ever-going anxiety and just gives me some assurance that everything will be alright.

Coincidentally, it has also become something that brought people closer for me. In the middle of lockdown, we started doing cook-a-longs with my team at work, and when it got to my turn to lead, this was just the obvious choice. When we were all stuck at home, and facing our own worries and anxieties alone, I felt like the food that always gave me comfort and relief could do the same for the team too.

So, when you are feeling overwhelmed by everything going on, I hope you try and cook a bowl of Lu-rou-fan, and may it brings the warmth to you like it does for me.
