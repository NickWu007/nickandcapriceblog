The holidays have just passed us, but I want to write a few words about one of our favorite snacks in the winter: roasted chestnuts. We make them at least once every winter now, partly as a nostalgia, also partly because they are absolutely delightful!

### Stables on the winter street

One memory that most of us will share about chestnuts would be the street cart snacks in markets or parks in the winter, just like the picture above. Every little round golden nut wrapped by a deeply brown shell, with a slit open in the middle that resembles a smile. In my childhood memories, they look more like little treasure chest actually, and once open give you a nugget of sweetness and happiness.

The chestnuts are not open just for the eyes, but it has a more practical reason. In a nutshell(pun intended), It offers an opening for the moisture inside the chestnuts to escape during the cooking. Otherwise, you could essentially turn it into steam and the whole chestnut would explode. Quite ironically, cutting open the chestnuts is less common in China, especially in the northern part where Caprice grew up. There is a funny story about it, and I will tell you in due time.

Coming back to the topic, around the Beijig/Tinajin area of China, chestnuts are also sold as a common street snack, but with a touch of flare and flavor. They are very slowly cooked in salt, or specially made little iron balls, over a long period of time. In this method, since the chestnuts are heated slowly and evenly, they can be dispensed from opening beforehand.

Now, here is the finishing touch. When the chestnuts are close to cooked, a mixture of oil and sugar are poured into the wok, and further mixed in. With the heat, the sugar starts to caramelize and eventually covers the chestnuts, and makes it even more tempting for walkers by. An interesting side effect is that the sugar also turns black and coats the iron balls, and forms the picture above.

### Ok, now let's make them ourselves!

I hope by now you are motivated enough to have a go yourself. Homemade roasted chestnuts are extremely foolproof, and works very well as a personal snack, or as a party appetizer!

To begin, here are the all the ingredients:
 
 - Fresh chestnuts
 - [Optional] Honey

Like I said, super easy, right? First let's preheat the oven to 180C/350F. While it heats up, we can also boil a kettle of water (I will explain why).

While we wait for both of them, we can prepare the chestnuts. Very carefully, use a knife to prick a opening at the center of each chestnuts. I found that if you hold the chestnut by your thumb and index finger on opposite ends, and aim the tip of the knife between them, it is very secure and you won't hurt yourself. Once we have the opening, try to use the blade of the knife to open it a bit more, like the classic slit that we see. Try not to cut the chestnut completely in half though, as that increases your chance of overcooking.

Now hopefully the kettle has boiled. Placing the prepped chestnuts in a big bowl, now pour the hot water over them until completely submerged. Once done, you will see little bubbles coming up to the surface. This is a neat trick that I learned only recently, as it releases the nut itself more from the inner film of the shell, making it easier to peel when we are done.

After about 10 minutes, take the chestnuts out of the water and dry them as much as possible with a kitchen towel or roll. At this point the oven should be ready to go, so let's tray up the chestnuts and pop them in the oven.

After about 15 minutes, open the oven to let out the steam and flip the chestnuts upside down, and then back in the oven for another 15 minutes.

Now we are basically done! Take out the chestnuts and let them cool for a bit before peeling off the shell. This bit could be a bit fiddly, but I find it a nice activity with Caprice and other friends.

Lastly, to simulate the sugar effect that Caprice grew up with, a touch of honey with the chestnuts and shaken up. Now we are ready to dig in!

### Our memories of chestnuts

Remember I mentioned that there was a funny story about chestnuts earlier? In the first winter that we spent together, Caprice stumbled onto a chestnut sale at our local supermarket, and I was really excited to make them as a movie snack. However, just as I was about to prick open the first chestnut, she said: "Do you have to do that? The ones I had never had a slit in the middle." Not aware of the regional variant, and more importantly the caveat of the cooking method, I also thought it was unnecessary to open them up.

So, all the chestnuts went into the oven unopen as is(mistake #1), and we started the movie. Just as the movie was getting interesting, I heard a muffled bang from the direction of the kitchen, which was followed by another one. Sensing it was probably the chestnuts, I rushed to the oven and pull them out of the oven(a bigger mistake). The sudden change of temperature turned out to trigger more explosions, and I just set the whole tray on the counter and went duck.

When all was settled, and Caprice was peeking from the side of the kitchen door, the aftermath was close to an indoor snowfall: white bits of the chestnuts covered every surface, as well as my hair. I remember looking up at her and feeling like an idiot, and every time since then we learned to always open the chestnuts up before the oven.

Jokes aside, chestnuts do represent something quite special for the two of us. For one thing, they are s memorabilia of childhood and remind us of the fun times in the park, or even just by a random street in the winter. For me, it was also a symbol of family. I remember the fond memories of Mother buying them for me just by the school gate, and us walking home and sharing the chestnuts. Also, since I have moved to London, having them with Caprice brings back the sense of family and comfort, and always brings a smile to me in the gloomy English winter.

So, would you pick up some chestnuts this coming winter? I hope they bring a little extra warmth, every cozy and fuzzy memories and a smile.
